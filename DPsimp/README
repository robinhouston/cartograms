Thanks for you interest in our paper.  I am now a bit embarassed at
the title that I gave it---to a theoretical computer scientist,
"speeding up" means "speeding up the worst-case performance."  My
further tests have indicated that the straightforward implementation
of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm runs a little bit faster on
cartographic data (although it has a far slower worst case running
time).  The fact that it uses trivial data structures probably make it
the implementation of choice.

I am including an ar archive with C code for our implementation and
for the straightforward implementation using a stack instead of
recursion.  The latter is easy enough to implement that you might want
to take my code (nonrec.c) as a guide and do your own.  This is
especially true because I have added timing and animation routines to
mine to create a video for the Video Review of the ACM Computational
Geometry conference.  If you have a silicon graphics, you can see the
animation by running  make  and then running  nonrec or hull.  If you
don't have an SGI, then  make opt  and  nonrec or hull  will be optimized
versions of the nonrecursive and path hull implementations.

To extract, save after the line as foo and type   ar x foo
The following files will be created:
nonrec.c	non-recursive implementation (the most interesting file)
DP.c		General routines for parsing arguments, random points, etc
DP.h
DPhull.c	Path hull implementation
PH.h
PH.c
DPhullfast.c	(somewhat optimized version)
animate.c	Display routines for SGI animation
animate.h
Makefile	compiles hull and nonrec, with or w/o animation
